> About
This repository contains a MATLAB package to perform dynamic mode decomposition based on expectation-maximization algorithm (EMDMD).
Details of EMDMD and its implementation are shown in paper entitled "Dynamic mode decomposition based on expectationâ€“maximization algorithm for simultaneous system identification and denoising" and published at Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing.
If you use EMDMD in your work, please cite paper.
