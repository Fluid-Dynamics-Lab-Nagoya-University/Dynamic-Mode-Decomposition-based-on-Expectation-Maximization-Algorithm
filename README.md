# Dynamic Mode Decomposition based on Expectation-Maximization algorithm
## About
This repository contains a MATLAB package to perform dynamic mode decomposition based on expectation-maximization algorithm (EMDMD).

Details of EMDMD and its implementation are shown in [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.111864) entitled "Dynamic mode decomposition based on expectationâ€“maximization algorithm for simultaneous system identification and denoising" and published at Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing.

If you use EMDMD in your work, please cite the relevent paper.

## File and directory
main.m: sample program performing EMDMD at sample data

function/EMDMD.m: main function of EMDMD

function/*.m (other files): functions essential for performing EMDMD

output: directory that includes results outputed when performing "main.m"

function: directory that includes functions essential for performing "main.m"

## Note
Please use "EMDMD.m" function with reference to "main.m" when you want to use EMDMD on your data
